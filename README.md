This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to detect fake news. We will first build a model using sklearn and regression using fake news dataset. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

Python Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning Matplotlib for data visualization Sklearn for model building.
